# Hackathon Rules

These are standard rules used at Hackathon.


## The rules of the Hackathon

1. There is a maximum team size of 3 people. 
2. Teams can work on project listed that have already been done. 
3. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. 
4. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon.
5. Any plagiarism in projects will not be entertained.


## Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria according to their discretion. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

- __Technology:__ How technically impressive was the project? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?
- __Design:__ Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
- __Completion:__ Does the project work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
- __Learning:__ Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of project? 

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:

- How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. 
- How well you pitch. Project is about building and learning.
- How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.
- How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!
